## Why does it interest me? 
Coming to NYU, I had no idea that internships were important in ultimately securing that full time offer we 
all desire. Moreover, once I hit my sophomore year, I heard all about this "LeetCode" platform, and that it was SUPER important in interviewing. Preivously, I had thought that: "Okay, that's how it is, and I'll just do that". On the contrary, after working an internship at a FinTech company and gaining some pratial experience, I can see both sides to the argument. While practicing LeetCode reinforces the concepts that are important within the overarching software engineering role, I don't think that it necessarily translates to who is going to be a good employee. In other words, I don't think that LeetCode is the best metric for judging candidates because there are so many other things to consider, such as social skills and experience, not to mention attitude. To speak expliclty, this reddit post was interesting to me because it proved that grinding LeetCode and ripping your hair out over time/space complexity isn't the only way to get a SWE job. I would love to hear what my peers have to say. Do you agree or disagree that more companies should move away from rigorous techinical questions?

This is really interesting to me because I completely agree that Leetcode does not expose all the skill of a candidate. In fact, someone could know many of the Leetcode problems like the back of their hand, but realistically be quite bad at practical coding. But on the flip side, I could see how it is difficult to test someone's technical skill. I am thinking that maybe side projects could be a great way to show your particular skill. I have also noticed that many companies are actually leaving the Leetcode space and are not asking more open ended technical questions during their interviews. In my opinion, this definitely creates a more comfortable space for candidates and doesn't put as much stress on getting little details correct.

For me, I can't deal with the pressure of being timed and making my brain work at the same time. Therefore, it has been a bit harder for me to do well in those. Therefore, I would definitely advocate for moving away from rigorous technical interviews. However, I do understand this might not realistic because technical interviews do provide a lot of insight about a candidate to the interviewer. I guess its just a matter of practice.
